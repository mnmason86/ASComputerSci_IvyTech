#### Exercise 4: Pseudocode
Identify and submit the five recommendations of pseudocode

1. **Use clear and concise language:**  Use straightforward English. There is no need for technical jargon or programming language syntax
2. **Focus on logic, not syntax:**  The main point of pseudocode is to outline the algorithm
3. **Employ standard programming structures:**  Use common control structures such as *IF-ELSE-THEN, FOR, WHILE,* and *FUNCTIONS* Capitalize key words for clarity.
4. **Use indentation for readability and hierarchy:**  Indent statements within control structures
5. **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps:**  Clearly describe what happens at each stage of the algorithm.
